# Improving Short-Term Rain Prediction by Deep Neural Networks
- ðŸ“„ **For full project report and detailed results, see the full report:** [report_mvi.pdf](report_mvi.pdf)  

This repository contains the project focused on improving short-term rain
prediction using deep neural networks, 
specifically comparing the performance of **ConvLSTM** and **PredRNN** architectures. 
The dataset consists of radar images from 2019 and 2020, which are used for 
spatio-temporal prediction of rainfall.
